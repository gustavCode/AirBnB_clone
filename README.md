## Project Definition
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## Command Interpreter

we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## How to start

To start your command interpreter

- Open the terminal and navigate to the project
- type ./console and you should see this prompt
	(hbnb) 

## How to use it

To use the command interpreter you can start by typing `help`.
It returns a list of documented commands. Now to see what
every command does type `help <command>`
Note: replace <command> with any commands provided

## Examples
- help quit
- create BaseModel
- show BaseModel <id>
- all BaseModel
- destroy BaseModel <id>
